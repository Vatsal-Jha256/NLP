# NLP Experiments and Models

This repo documents my exploration into natural language processing techniques through practical implementations.

Current projects include:

    LLM Chatbot: An conversational agent powered by model retrieval using the RAG framework
    Disaster Tweet Classification: Categorizing tweets into disaster vs non-disaster tweets using text classification models
    English to French Translation: Sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation from English to French

These provide hands-on experience with:

    Text preprocessing and feature extraction
    Sentiment analysis and text classification
    Sequence modeling, attention mechanisms
    Fine-tuning large language models

Over time I plan to continue expanding my NLP skills by adding new notebooks on topics like:

    Text generation with n-gram models and LSTMs
    Named entity recognition
    Question answering systems
    Text summarization techniques
    and more!

This repository serves to chart my progress in gaining practical intuition for real-world NLP. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
